# Multi-Commodity-Trading-scheme 
This work is design to allow a smart marketplace participant to trade multiple commodities (resources) such as energy, water or internet bandwidth with many participants (buyers or sellers) at same time.
The project was just a framework which is still under testing and improvement.
